GET & DISPLAY JSON DATA

What This Does:
Fetches JSON from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users (a free fake API).

Parses it and loops through the user data.

Displays each user's name, email, and city inside a styled <div>.


##  Why Is It Important?

If you want to build modern, interactive, data-driven websites or apps — knowing how to fetch and display JSON using JavaScript is a must.

🌐 1. Dynamic Web Content
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the most common data format used in web APIs.

Being able to fetch JSON lets you dynamically update your website without reloading the page.

Example: A weather app, news feed, or user dashboard pulling real-time data.

🔄 2. Client-Server Communication
Modern web apps follow a frontend-backend architecture.

The frontend (HTML + JS) fetches JSON from the backend (usually via REST APIs).

It’s the standard way to send and receive data between client and server.

📦 3. Work with Real-World APIs
Whether you're working with public APIs (e.g., Google Maps, GitHub, OpenWeather) or custom ones, they all return JSON.

Knowing how to handle it makes you ready to build real, useful apps.

⚙️ 4. Essential for Single-Page Applications (SPA)
Frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular heavily rely on fetching and displaying JSON data.

Even in plain JavaScript, it’s the backbone of dynamic and interactive pages.

🚀 5. Enhances User Experience
JSON allows faster updates and responses without reloading the page (AJAX).

This leads to smoother, modern web experiences (like infinite scrolling, auto-refresh data, etc.).

🎓 6. Crucial Skill for Developers
It's a fundamental skill in both frontend and full-stack development.

Interviewers often ask questions involving JSON fetching/parsing.

Most job-ready projects use JSON to interact with data.
